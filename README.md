This is the companion github repo for the [How to build your first SaaS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-your-first-saas/) article.

## Description

A minimal foundation upon which you can putter your first full-stack application.

"**Why not just `create-react-app` etc. though?**" They are great for one-off prototype or "move fast and break things" kind of environment. But we are building a garden we intend to _putter_ while comporting ourselves with the greatest freedom and rectitude possible.

## Features

- Already setup server and client
- Lighter footprint than CRA on your machine
- Preact(alternatively, I suggest [Sinuous](https://sinuous.dev/) which doesn't use virtual dom)
- Supports IE11
- Serves ES modules(less code shipped) to modern browsers
- Use the web platform as much as possible(e.g. Not using SCSS. Leverage standard CSS with PostCSS)
